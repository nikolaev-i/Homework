# Write a Calculator program with the following functionality:
# - The user chooses the operation 
# - add, subtract, multiply, divide   = check whether the choice is valid   = every operation should be a separate function 
# - The user enters the numbers for the operation   = check for valid inputs 
# - only numbers allowed 
# - The user is presented with the result from the operation or an error message   = division by zero error handling   = try different formatting for the floating point numbers (1,2,3,4 numbers after the decimal) 
# - The user can choose whether to proceed with a new calculation or exit the program 
# Example: Select operation. 
# 1.Add 
# 2.Subtract 
# 3.Multiply 
# 4.Divide 
# Enter choice: (1/2/3/4): 3 
# Enter first number: 15 
# Enter second number: 14 15.0 * 14.0 = 210.0
#  Would you like to do a new calculation? 
#  (yes/no): no
